# Search teams

Two engineering teams at Sourcegraph are focused solely on search:

- [Search Platform](./core.md)
- [Search Suite](../search-suite/index.md)

Together, they own the end-to-end Sourcegraph search experience.

To learn more about our vision, guiding principles and strategy for search, see the [Search strategy](../../../../strategy-goals/strategy/search/index.md) page.
